# MySQL ALTER TABLE â€“ Add columns to a table ---------------------------------

/*
To add a column to a table, you use the ALTER TABLE ADD syntax:

# ADD
ALTER TABLE table_name
    ADD new_column_name column_definition
    [FIRST | AFTER column_name],
    
    ADD new_column_name column_definition
    [FIRST | AFTER column_name],
    ...;
    
# MODIFIY 
ALTER TABLE table_name
    MODIFY column_name column_definition
    [ FIRST | AFTER column_name],
    MODIFY column_name column_definition
    [ FIRST | AFTER column_name],
    ...;
    

*/

# 1. Add two columns in above table
select * from empl;

ALTER TABLE empl
ADD city VARCHAR(50),
ADD email2 VARCHAR(255);

select * from empl;
# 2. modify table column
describe empl;
ALTER TABLE empl 
MODIFY email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL;
describe empl;

# 3. rename column
ALTER TABLE empl 
CHANGE COLUMN city addr VARCHAR(100);
# 4. Drop both new columns 
ALTER TABLE empl
DROP COLUMN email;
select * from empl;
# 5. rename table empl to test
ALTER TABLE empl 
RENAME TO test2;

select * from test;
# 6. Drop table test
DROP TABLE empl;
select * from empl;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test;

# MySQL UPDATE statement
/*
The following illustrates the basic syntax of the UPDATE statement:

UPDATE [LOW_PRIORITY] [IGNORE] table_name 
SET 
    column_name1 = expr1,
    column_name2 = expr2,
    ...
[WHERE
    condition];

*/

# 1. update the email of any emplyees to the new email 
select * from employees;

SELECT

# 4. add 100$ to all product price in products table

select * from products;

UPDATE products 
SET

# MySQL DELETE and LIMIT clause ----------------------

# You are using a safe mode and you tried to update a table without a WHERE that uses a Key column.

# 1. delete all records from the task table
select * from task;
delete from task;
drop table task;

# 2. delete all records where country is france
select * from customers;
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE country = 'France';

# 3. delete top 5 records where country is USA
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE country = 'USA' 
ORDER BY creditLimit desc
LIMIT 5;


#  MySQL GROUP BY clause ----------------------

 /*
 SELECT 
    c1, c2,..., cn, aggregate_function(ci)
FROM
    table
WHERE
    where_conditions
GROUP BY c1 , c2,...,cn;
 */

# 1. select status group value from orders 
select * from orders;

SELECT 
    status
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY status;
# or 
SELECT DISTINCT
    status
FROM
    orders;

# 2. count number of orders in each status
select count(*) from orders;




SELECT 
    `status`, COUNT(*) as `count no`
FROM
    `orders`
GROUP BY `status`;

# 3. returns the order numbers and the 
# total amount of each order.



select * from orderdetails;

select * from orders;
SELECT 
    YEAR(orderDate) AS year, 
    COUNT(orderNumber) `count xys`
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY 
    year;

# HAVING Clause ----------------------
/*
The  HAVING clause is used in the SELECT statement to specify 
filter conditions for a group of rows or aggregates.
The following illustrates the syntax of the HAVING clause:

SELECT 
    select_list
FROM 
    table_name
WHERE 
    search_condition
GROUP BY 
    group_by_expression
HAVING 
    group_condition;

    SUM(quantityOrdered) AS itemsCount,
    SUM(priceeach*quantityOrdered) AS total
FROM
    orderdetails
GROUP BY ordernumber;

# 2.  find which order has total sales greater than 1000

SELECT 
    ordernumber,
    SUM(quantityOrdered) AS itemsCount,
    SUM(priceeach*quantityOrdered) AS total
FROM
    orderdetails
GROUP BY 
   ordernumber

    orderdetails
GROUP BY ordernumber
HAVING 
    total > 1000 AND 
    `items Count` > 600;

# MySQL alias for tables and columns  ----------------------

/*
he following statement illustrates how to use the column alias:

SELECT 
   [column_1 | expression] AS descriptive_name
FROM table_name;

or 

SELECT 
   [column_1 | expression] AS `descriptive name`
FROM 
   table_name;
*/


# 1. join first name and last name

SELECT 
    CONCAT_WS('_', lastName, firstname)
FROM
    employees;

# or 

SELECT
	CONCAT_WS(', ', lastName, firstname) `Full name`
FROM
	employees
    
ORDER BY
	`Full name`;


# 2. selects the orders whose total amount are greater than 60000.

SELECT
	orderNumber `Order no.`,
	SUM(priceEach * quantityOrdered) total
FROM
	orderDetails
GROUP BY
	`Order no.`
HAVING
	total > 60000;
    
# 3. use alias name for table

SELECT 
    e.firstName, 
    e.lastName
FROM
    employees e
ORDER BY e.firstName;


# MySQL Joins ----------------------------------

/*

MySQL supports the following types of joins:

1. Inner join
2. Left join
3. Right join
4. Cross join

*/


# 1. create sample table meber and committes


CREATE TABLE members (
    member_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (member_id)
);

CREATE TABLE committees (
    committee_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,

INSERT INTO members(name)
VALUES('John'),('Jane'),('Mary'),('David'),('Amelia');

INSERT INTO committees(name)
VALUES('John'),('Mary'),('Amelia'),('Joe');

SELECT * FROM members;
SELECT * FROM committees;

# 1. INNER JOIN -----

/*
The following shows the basic syntax 
of the inner join clause that joins two tables table_1 and table_2:

SELECT column_list
FROM table_1
INNER JOIN table_2 ON join_condition;

If the join condition uses the equal operator (=) 
and the column names in both tables used 
for matching are the same, you can use the USING clause instead:

SELECT column_list
FROM table_1
INNER JOIN table_2 USING (column_name);

*/

# 1. finds members who are also the committee members:


SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name as `name`, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name `committee`
FROM
    members m
INNER JOIN committees c

# 2. LEFT JOIN -----

/*
The following shows the basic syntax 
of the inner join clause that joins two tables table_1 and table_2:

SELECT column_list 
FROM table_1 
LEFT JOIN table_2 ON join_condition;

If the join condition uses the equal operator (=)

# 3. RIGHT JOIN -----

/*
The following shows the basic syntax 
of the inner join clause that joins two tables table_1 and table_2:

SELECT column_list 
FROM table_1 
RIGHT JOIN table_2 ON join_condition;

If the join condition uses the equal operator (=) 
and the column names in both tables used 
for matching are the same, you can use the USING clause instead:

# 4. CROSS JOIN 

/*
The following shows the basic syntax of the cross join clause:

SELECT select_list
FROM table_1
CROSS JOIN table_2;

*/

SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS  members,

SELECT 
    t1.orderNumber,
    t1.status,
    SUM(quantityOrdered * priceEach) total
FROM
    orders t1
INNER JOIN orderdetails t2 
    ON t1.orderNumber = t2.orderNumber

# 3. uses two INNER JOIN clauses to join three tables: orders, orderdetails, and products:

SELECT 
    orderNumber,
    orderDate,
    orderLineNumber,
    productName,
    quantityOrdered,

INNER JOIN products 
    USING (productCode)
INNER JOIN customers 
    USING (customerNumber)
ORDER BY 
    orderNumber, 
    orderLineNumber;
    
# 5. use the LEFT JOIN clause to find all customers and their orders:

SELECT 
    customers.customerNumber, 
    customerName, 
    orderNumber, 
    status
FROM
    customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON 
    orders.customerNumber = customers.customerNumber;
    
# 6. use two LEFT JOIN clauses to join the three tables: employees, customers, and payments.

SELECT 
    lastName, 
    firstName, 
    customerName, 
    checkNumber, 
    amount
FROM
    employees
LEFT JOIN customers ON 
    employeeNumber = salesRepEmployeeNumber
LEFT JOIN payments ON 
    payments.customerNumber = customers.customerNumber
ORDER BY 
    customerName, 
    checkNumber; 

# 7.  use the RIGHT JOIN clause join the table customers with the table employees

SELECT 
    employeeNumber, 
    customerNumber
FROM
    customers
RIGHT JOIN employees 
    ON salesRepEmployeeNumber = employeeNumber
ORDER BY 
	employeeNumber;

# 8. use the RIGHT JOIN clause to find employees who do not in charge of any customers:


SELECT 
    employeeNumber, 
    customerNumber
FROM
    customers
RIGHT JOIN employees ON 
	salesRepEmployeeNumber = employeeNumber
WHERE customerNumber is NULL
ORDER BY employeeNumber;

# 9. To get the whole organization structure, you can join the 
# employees table to itself using the employeeNumber and reportsTo columns. 
# The table employees has two roles: one is the Manager and the other is Direct Reports.

select * from employees;


SELECT 
    CONCAT(m.lastName, ', ', m.firstName) AS Manager,
